# **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project focuses on **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)**, where a deep learning model is trained to classify facial expressions into seven distinct emotions:  

- **Angry** 😠  
- **Disgust** 🤢  
- **Fear** 😨  
- **Happy** 😊  
- **Sad** 😢  
- **Surprise** 😲  
- **Neutral** 😐  

The model is trained on the **FER2013** dataset using **ResNet50**, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN), for high-accuracy emotion classification.

## 📂 **Dataset**  
The **FER2013** (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) dataset is used for training and evaluation. It consists of:  

- **Images**: 48x48 grayscale facial images  
- **Classes**: 7 emotion categories  
- **Total Samples**: 35,887 images  
- **Train/Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
